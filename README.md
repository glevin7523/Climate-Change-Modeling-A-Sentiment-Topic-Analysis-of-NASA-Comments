# üåç Climate Change Modeling

> Exploring global climate trends through data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

---

## üß† Overview

This project focuses on understanding the patterns and trends in **global climate change** using real-world data from NASA. It includes data cleaning, visual analysis, and the development of regression models to predict climate indicators like global temperatures and CO‚ÇÇ levels.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Details

- **Source**: NASA Climate Data (`climate_nasa.csv`)
- **Features Include**:
  - Yearly average temperatures
  - CO‚ÇÇ concentrations
  - Sea level rise indicators
  - Methane (CH‚ÇÑ) and Nitrous oxide (N‚ÇÇO) levels
  - Emission patterns over time

## üìå Key Insights

- **Global average temperature** has been increasing significantly since the 1950s.  
- There is a strong **positive correlation between CO‚ÇÇ levels and temperature anomalies**.  
- **Sea levels are rising steadily**, mirroring greenhouse gas emissions.  
- Methane and nitrous oxide also contribute to the long-term climate impact.

## üì∑ Visualizations

The notebook includes:
- Time-series plots of global temperature anomalies  
- CO‚ÇÇ vs Temperature scatter plots  
- Heatmaps showing inter-feature correlations  
- Decade-wise emission trend charts  
- Forecasted climate metrics using regression lines
